# rEuropeFiltered
Plugin for [GreaseMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) that adds filter buttons to reddit's /r/Europe to filter out topics by key words. 

Since the mods of /r/Europe do not believe giving users the ability to filter unwanted topics, and I was thoroughly fed up with the flood of refugee-related links that brought out the little bydlo in the normally well-behaved inhabitants of /r/Europe, I decided to code me a little filter. And why not open-source it so others could get a peace of mind.

## How to use
You need to run a relatively recent FireFox. It may or may not work on another browser like Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer or Chrome, but I never tested it on any of those and do not support them *at all*. Likewise it might work with another userscript plugin, but I have never tried and do not care.

## How to install
Fire up your FireFox browser. You then need to install GreaseMonkey first. Either go to the "Tools" menu and select "Add-ons" or go to [about:addons](about:addons), then navigate to "User scripts".
